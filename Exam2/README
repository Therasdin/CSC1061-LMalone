The goal of this project is to find the file sizes of files and directories/folders. We will first build the 
tree of files using the File object in Java that provides details about the particular file/folder and also
the array of files/folders under it. 

The implementation of a node in the tree is provided in FileNode.java.
FileSizeFinder.java is the driver program that traverses the tree that uses iterators that you will implement
to find the file/folder sizes and print them to the screen. See Expected Output below for what should be printed.
The size of a folder is the sum of the sizes of all it's children. Hence, the need for a post-order traversal. 
All the children should be visited first to get their sizes before we can determine the size of the parent. 

Download and unzip the FileTest.zip file from the D2L Assignment folder.
Note the path where you unzipped the folder. For example, C:\Downloads\FileTest. 
Set filePath in FileSizeFinder.java to this path.

There are three TODOs in FileTree.java. Please follow the directions in the TODO comments to complete 
these sections of code. 
The first one is to build the FileNode tree using the File object using a recursive algorithm. 
The second is to complete the class that can be instantiated as a depth-first, post-order traversal iterator.
The third is to complete the class that can be instantiated as a breadth-first traversal iterator 

Expected Output:
